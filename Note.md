## 🌍 Our Vision

To build a **unified digital ecosystem** connecting over **250,000 faith and ceremonial service entities** across the EU — from rural parishes to metropolitan cathedrals, from family-run funeral homes to regional cemetery networks.

We are not building generic software.  
We are building **digital sanctuaries** — where **faith meets function**, and **tradition meets technology**.
